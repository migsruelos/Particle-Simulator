# Problem Set 1 : Particle Simulation

This is a particle simulation application that allows you to add particles to the environment with different initial positions, angles, and velocities. The particles will travel in a straight line, bouncing off the four walls of the canvas and any user-defined walls. The collisions are elastic, which means the particles do not lose or gain speed after bouncing. You can also add particles in batches with varying parameters. The application will show the FPS (frames per second) counter on-screen every 0.5 seconds.

# Requirements

Java 8 or higher.

# Usage

* Run the JAR file
  * This will open a window with 1280 x 720 pixel canvas. The coordinates (0, 0) is the southwest corner of the canvas, and the coordinate (1280, 720) is the northeast corner.
* In this window, the user will be presented with four buttons.
  * Three of the buttons are for the user to add particles.
